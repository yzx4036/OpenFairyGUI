## Documentation / 文档联动

- Updated documents, or why no update is needed / 已更新文档或不适用理由：
- Bilingual changelog needed? / 是否需要双语发布日志：

- [ ] Reviewed the impact-map documents and the [repository rules](../AGENTS.md); relevant protocol, publish settings, architecture and entrypoints are synchronized.
- [ ] Generated contracts/installed content from canonical sources when affected; no manual snapshot, dist or API-page edits.
- [ ] For a release/version change, both changelogs agree on version, release link, category and content; otherwise explain why not applicable.

## Verification / 验证证据

<!-- Report actual commands, base ref/commit, results and limitations. An unchecked or failed item is not a pass. -->

- Tested base / 验证基准：
- Commands and results / 实际命令与结果：
- Not run or failed, and why / 未运行或失败项及原因：
- Consumer/runtime scope not proven / 尚未证明的消费端或运行时行为：

- [ ] Recorded checks appropriate to the change: `pnpm docs:check` for ordinary documentation, `pnpm check:fast --base origin/next` with the actual PR target for code, or `pnpm check:ci` for broad changes/package-specific requirements. Any missing or failed check is recorded above; required CI must pass before merge.
- [ ] For publication, `pnpm pack:check --artifacts <release-directory>` passed on the exact five tarballs to be published; otherwise not applicable.

See [development and verification](../docs/guide/development.md). This checklist records evidence; checking boxes does not replace automated checks or authorize publication.
