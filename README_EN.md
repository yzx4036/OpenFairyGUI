> Read, modify, and publish FairyGUI projects with TypeScript for scripts, CI/CD, and agent tooling.

## What is OpenFairyGUI?

OpenFairyGUI is a FairyGUI project SDK for Node.js and automation workflows. It provides composable TypeScript packages for project I/O, document transforms, publishing, and backend sessions, together with CLI and MCP entrypoints.

Use it to:

- Inspect or update FairyGUI projects in batches
- Publish runtime assets from a build pipeline
- Add project capabilities to generators, browser editors, or agents
- Analyze Project XML and FairyGUI binary packages

## Key capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Project I/O | Read, modify, and write `.fairy` project directories and assets |
| Binary protocol | Read and write `.fui` / `_fui.bytes` publish packages |
| Headless authoring | Apply batch changes through `Document` or UAM transactions |
| Publish and recovery | Publish runtime assets and perform limited recovery from trusted local artifacts |
| Tool integration | Use the CLI, stateful backend runtime, or MCP adapter |

## Quick start

Install the scripting packages:

```bash
npm install @openfairygui/core @openfairygui/functions
```

Read and publish a project:

```ts
import { NodeIO } from '@openfairygui/core/node';
import { inspect } from '@openfairygui/functions';
import { publishNode } from '@openfairygui/functions/node';

const io = new NodeIO();
const doc = await io.readProject('./MyProject/MyProject.fairy');

const report = inspect(doc);
console.log(report.projectType, report.totals.packages);

await publishNode({
  document: doc,
  assetsPath: './MyProject/assets',
  output: './release',
});
```

See [Getting Started](https://fairygui.dev/guide/getting-started) for project writeback, Web entrypoints, and UAM examples.

## Command line

```bash
npm install --global @openfairygui/cli

ofgui inspect ./MyProject
ofgui publish ./MyProject --output ./release
```

Run `ofgui --help` for all commands and options.

## Status and boundaries

The project is currently in the `0.2.0` alpha series. APIs may still change before the stable release.

- Node.js automation is the primary workflow; browser hosts use explicit `/web` entrypoints and injected capabilities.
- UAM writeback is rejected when the project cannot be preserved faithfully, preventing silent source overwrites.
- `restore` is limited to trusted local publish artifacts and is not a normal authoring workflow.

The [documentation site](https://fairygui.dev/) defines the current implementation boundaries.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm lint
