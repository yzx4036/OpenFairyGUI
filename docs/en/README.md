## Conventions

| Item | Policy |
|---|---|
| Audience | Agent and tool users, editor-host developers, repository maintainers, and protocol contributors. |
| Source of truth | Documentation follows the current repository implementation; synchronization requirements are defined in `AGENTS.md`. |
| Root READMEs | `README.md` and `README_EN.md` provide navigation rather than protocol specifications. |
| Website build | Use `pnpm docs:dev` for local development. `pnpm docs:build` generates the public API reference and static site. |
