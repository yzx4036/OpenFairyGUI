# Repository development and verification

This guide is for contributors and agents. SDK users should start with [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) and [Packages and Tools](./packages.md). Run every command from the repository root.

## First checkout

Prepare Git, Node.js and pnpm using your existing version-management tools. `.node-version` selects the recommended development major (22); the root `packageManager` selects the exact pnpm version (10.14.0). No personal machine paths or global agent configuration are required.

Package metadata declares Node `>=22`. CI, documentation deployment and releases all use Node 22 from `.node-version`. Newer majors satisfy the declared package range but are not continuously verified. Development dependencies can require newer patch releases of Node 22.

```bash
pnpm repo:setup
```

`repo:setup` initializes submodules at their Git-recorded commits, installs with the frozen lockfile, builds, runs repository-tool tests and runs doctor. It writes dependencies/build output and initializes submodules; it does not rewrite the lockfile, select Node or install global tools. Use `repo:setup`, not pnpm's built-in `setup` environment command.

For a dirty checkout, consider an isolated worktree before dependency or documentation work. Do not reset user changes, delete dependencies or regenerate the lockfile to work around an environment problem. Submodule network/TLS failures are acquisition failures, not evidence of a Node or product regression.

## Verification entrypoints

Choose one entrypoint for the task, rather than running every command in order. Use `check:ci` when package-level AGENTS require full checks.

| Task | Command | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| First checkout | `pnpm repo:setup` | Pinned fixtures, installation, build, repository-tool tests and environment diagnosis; ready to start development |
| Code changes | `pnpm check:fast --base origin/next` | Lint, typecheck, basic repository-tool tests and guidance checks; build before selected AVA tests. Replace the base with the actual PR target |
| Ordinary documentation changes | `pnpm docs:check` | Local links, agent paths/commands, impact-table drift, public source mappings, bilingual entries, Changelog structure and contract drift |
| Broad changes or full CI reproduction | `pnpm check:ci` | Fixtures, lint, typecheck, guidance/contracts, build, all repository-tool and AVA tests, tarball consumers and documentation build |

Use the same base for preview and execution. `--list` only prints a plan; it does not run lint, typecheck or builds:

```bash
pnpm check:fast --base origin/next --list
pnpm check:fast --base origin/next
```

Fast checks are not a full regression. Ordinary documentation excludes site configuration and theme code under `docs/.vitepress/`. Run `pnpm docs:build` when you need a page preview; it explicitly generates TypeDoc API pages before building VitePress. CI still checks and builds documentation.

### Focused checks and environment diagnosis

`pnpm test:repo` runs built-in Node tests for repository tooling without product builds or external fixtures. `pnpm check` is the product-check composition used by CI's quality job (fixtures, lint, typecheck, build, repository-tool tests and all AVA tests). For daily work, choose from the table rather than stacking these commands.

`pnpm repo:doctor --json` reports read-only Node/pnpm, dependency, exported-file, native-image, temporary-directory permission and reference status.

Doctor does not install, download, configure or write files; submodule status queries also disable Git's optional index-refresh writes. Export-file presence does not prove build freshness or Node/Web runtime behavior; `pack:check` verifies actual consumer boundaries. Sharp checks exercise in-memory PNG/JPEG encoding and pixel decoding, not just version metadata; unavailable or failed codecs warn, without proving real publish/restore workflows. The temporary path must be an accessible directory, but access flags do not prove ACL permissions, free space, later writes or rollback. A non-recommended Node major warns; an unsupported Node version, mismatched pnpm or missing required fixtures/build output fails.

### Changed-test selection

`agent/impact-map.json` is the only mapping source. `pnpm test:changed --matrix` renders the marked table in root AGENTS, and guidance checks reject drift.

- `check:fast` requires an explicit `--base` or PR `GITHUB_BASE_REF`; if both are missing, it fails with usage guidance. The lower-level `test:changed` can still fall back to local `origin/HEAD`. No automatic fetch occurs; the ref must exist locally. An explicitly supplied but unavailable base still selects the full suite.
- The plan combines branch changes since merge-base, staged, unstaged and untracked paths. Renames include old and new paths; deletions are included.
- The first matching rule wins. Core/test-utils cover all downstream packages; functions/backend cover their consumers. CLI also selects Backend's bootstrap tests.
- Unknown paths, dependency/shared configuration changes, unavailable bases/shallow history and no changes fall back to the entire suite, never an empty success.
- Recognized documentation-only work may use repository-only mode, which still runs tooling tests and guidance checks. `check:ci` additionally builds the documentation.
- Every selected test group must match files. Listed documents are review prompts, not a demand to rewrite unrelated protocol descriptions.
- Selected AVA tests always follow a workspace build so built CLI/MCP/backend tests cannot load stale dependency output; build failures stop execution. Documentation-only mode and `--list`/`--matrix` do not build.
- Tests use pnpm's AVA shim, preserving the environment required by existing isolated-build tests. Do not call AVA's raw JS entrypoint. Direct Node invocation of the selection script supports plan/matrix inspection only.

PR CI first fetches full Git history and classifies changes against the PR base commit using the existing impact map through `test:changed --list`. Only a `repository-only` plan skips quality/consumer jobs; documentation still runs the repository script checks in `scripts/repository.test.mjs`, `docs:check` and `docs:build`. Code, site configuration, scripts, dependencies, unknown paths, no changes or an unavailable comparison base select full checks. A failed scope job also does not silently skip product checks. The workflow remains triggered; only individual jobs are skipped.

Full CI runs `check` on Node 22. Documentation runs guidance checks and builds on the same Node major; consumer jobs run `pack:check` on Linux/Windows with that Node major. Documentation and consumer jobs do not download fixtures. These three full job types correspond to local `check:ci`; documentation-only routing is not a full regression, and `check:fast` and `check` do not install tarballs. Pushes to main always run full checks. A new run for the same PR cancels its older run; separate pushes to main do not cancel each other. Remote URLs, heading anchors, translation meaning and protocol accuracy still require review.

Local `check:ci` verifies fixtures, lint, types and guidance, then runs `pack:check`, followed by all repository-tool tests, AVA and documentation builds. `pack:check` performs the contract check and workspace build once each; AVA uses that run's output, without caches or skip flags. Standalone `pack:check` still checks contracts and builds for itself. Separate remote CI jobs prepare their own required output.

The release workflow installs npm 11 separately on Node 22 to meet the CLI requirements for [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/). Repository dependency installation and verification still use the pinned pnpm version.

`pnpm pack:check` builds and installs five tarballs outside the checkout, verifying public entries, types, CLI/MCP, Node examples and real Chromium OPFS edits/save/reload/locks/paths/image bytes. It installs dependencies over the network and downloads the matching browser on first use; successful runs remove their temporary directory, failures preserve it, and `--keep` preserves successful runs too. Release uses `pnpm pack:check --artifacts .release` to check the same packed files. See [Runnable Examples and Consumer Verification](./examples.md) for entrypoints, examples and limits.

Use the repository's `.github/pull_request_template.md` to identify affected packages, UAM/Backend/MCP/CLI contracts, version handling, documentation and bilingual changelogs, together with the actual tested base, commands and failed/unrun checks. The template records review evidence; checkboxes neither replace CI nor authorize publication or prove verification.

Agent evaluations share that tarball installation. `pnpm eval:agent --runner reference` runs ten deterministic tasks, including editing, safe stops and separate publish/recovery tasks; these already gate consumer verification. `pnpm eval:agent --runner codex --codex codex` runs real-model tasks manually, with success rates used only as observations. See [Real Agent Task Evaluations](./agent-evaluations.md) for tasks, isolation, Windows executable requirements and reproduction.

## Reference evidence

`references.json` records only public fixture roles and probe files. The three required upstream submodules live under `packages/test-utils/test/fixtures/`:

| Submodule | Authority |
|---|---|
| FairyGUI-Editor | Current editor UI, settings and plugin API; not the legacy binary exporter |
| FairyGUI-layabox | Layabox consumption code and paired demo source/published resources |
| FairyGUI-unity | Unity consumption code and paired example source/published resources |

URLs come only from `.gitmodules`; commits come only from Git gitlinks. `pnpm refs:sync` retrieves those versions. Builds and tests use these public submodules, the tracked FairyGUI-Experiments project and generated minimal test objects.

`pnpm refs:status` observes status without failing for missing material; `pnpm refs:sync` initializes/updates to gitlinks without tracking remote tips or forcing overwrites; `pnpm refs:verify` strictly checks required fixture commits, working trees and probe files. `pnpm refs:grep "literal text"` verifies before searching for a case-sensitive literal, returning repository-relative paths and line numbers; exit codes are 0 for matches, 1 for no match and 2 for errors.

`refs:grep` reuses that registration and verification, searching only tracked text in the three submodules. It skips binaries, untracked/ignored files and files outside the registered scope. Missing, dirty, mismatched or incomplete fixtures and Git search failures prevent partial success; resolve the reported problem without automatic synchronization or overwrites. A path/line match locates evidence; it does not make that source authoritative for legacy exporters. For a particular source or richer queries, first verify its status and role with `refs:status`, then use native Git/rg in that directory.

Base protocol conclusions on maintained repository documentation, pinned public fixtures and publicly verifiable primary sources. Record sources, applicable versions and test evidence. If decisive evidence for a field or publishing rule is missing, mark that conclusion unverified, stop it and identify the missing material; unrelated work can continue. Public fixture status checks do not establish every protocol rule.

Check output naming and settings against public documentation, source projects and paired published artifacts for the relevant version; establish field ownership through real XML tags. Verify behavior separately for each version; runtime compatibility alone does not establish a project or publishing protocol. Prefer paired semantic binary checks, not a lone package or header Version difference.

## Product documentation and repository diagnosis

Installed packages use `ofgui docs` and `ofgui doctor --json` without a checkout. `pnpm contracts:generate` updates contracts and corpus under `packages/backend/src/generated/`; package-version, workflow and thin-skill changes also require regeneration and `pnpm contracts:check`. `pnpm pack:check` verifies CLI/MCP corpus parity, versions, doctor and the packaged skill. Repository prerequisites still use `pnpm repo:doctor`; see [installed docs](./installed-docs.md).

Contract generation uses Core/Backend/CLI types to update MCP/CLI structures, operations, diagnostic guides, snapshots and bilingual tables. `contracts:check` checks mappings, formal diagnostic coverage/ownership and generated drift without writing; repository tests separately check CLI command registration coverage. See the [contract guide](./contracts.md) for change entrypoints.

## Small glossary

| Term | Meaning here |
|---|---|
| Source Project / Published Package | Editable authoring project versus runtime output; different contracts |
| UAM / Document | Public declarative authoring model versus mutable low-level property graph; transaction guarantees belong to the UAM entrypoint |
| Lift / Materialize | Document to UAM / UAM to Document; materialization is not saving or publishing |
| Session / Revision | Backend editing state and its version; mutations supply expectedRevision |
| Transaction support / Apply | Support checking and execution are distinct; success does not guarantee saving |
| Source bytes | Explicitly hydrated binary data, not preserved through JSON cloning |
| Capability plane | Separate service/host capability scopes; reading does not imply editing, saving or publishing |
| Semantic round-trip | Preservation of supported meaning, not byte-for-byte XML or binary equality |

Root and package AGENTS own package rules and public-contract pointers. The [architecture overview](../architecture-overview.md) explains actual data flows. Do not edit `packages/*/dist/`, `docs/public/api/` or `docs/.vitepress/dist/` directly. New key documentation must update both root READMEs and documentation indexes; releases update both Changelogs. Structural checks do not replace semantic review.

See [Development Task Recipes](./task-recipes.md) for concrete entrypoints, evidence requirements and acceptance checks. It navigates existing implementation, not a second protocol or operation grammar.
