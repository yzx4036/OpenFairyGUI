# Diagnostics and Recovery

Backend owns session/runtime errors. Core owns transaction errors/support issues and `ProjectDiagnosticCode` read/validation diagnostics. Functions orchestration and MCP transport do not change that ownership. Backend metadata and events preserve codes, severity, paths and operation locations; Core errors and validation report bodies remain unchanged.

`BackendDiagnostic.code` is the canonical union of Backend errors, Core transaction errors/support issues and Core project-validation codes. All 102 unique codes have guides. `contracts:check` rejects missing, duplicate, unknown and incorrectly owned codes against those sources. Catalog `owners` lists every canonical origin of a shared code; response `owner` retains its actual origin, including transaction versus project-validation uses of `invalid_uam`.

Formal diagnostics add `owner`, `docsUri` and `remediation { kind, message, read? }`. Unknown host inputs outside the typed contract preserve their original error without promised guidance. Capability schema 9 declares `manifest.diagnostics.recoveryGuides: all-formal-codes` and `automaticRepair: false`. CLI process errors have a separate [CLI output contract](./contracts.md#cli-machine-output), not Backend diagnostic identities.

`read` is only an executable read-only starting point: `getProjectOutline({ sessionId })`, mapped to `openfairygui_backend_get_project_outline` by MCP. See [contracts](./contracts.md). Query current properties and replan; never merely replace `expectedRevision` on the original transaction. Previews reserve no revision; saving has its own guard.

`host-action` means there is no safe automatic recovery step. Source hydration belongs to host project I/O, path rejection requires an authorization review, and expired sessions require protecting unsaved work before reopening. Never invent hydrate/repair tools, suppress diagnostics, or widen path policy. For gear/branch details absent from the outline, query the owning entity or ask the host rather than guessing selectors.

SDK: `getBackendDiagnosticCatalog()` / `getBackendDiagnosticGuide(code)`. MCP: read `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics` or a per-code URI below. Unknown codes fail explicitly. Guides never execute actions.

`revise-operation` covers invalid payloads, conflicts, references and unsupported edits: read schemas and current entities before replanning; never delete data to bypass a failure. Report an already-satisfied no-op, preserve dirty state and inspect actual files after a write failure, and never delete a live lock. Complete guidance does not imply automatic repair.

<!-- diagnostics:start -->
### stale_read

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `refresh-and-replan`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/stale_read`

Discard the incomplete model/bytes read and restart with readSessionState. Use its revision for every readResourceBytes call. No historical state is retained or reserved; do not combine resources from different edit revisions.

### session_read_failed

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/session_read_failed`

Inspect error.reason: invalid_query requires valid inputs; not_found/ambiguous requires exact current resource identifiers; unsupported_resource/bytes_unavailable means primary bytes cannot be read from this session. Budget or non-JSON failures require host inspection. Preserve unsaved work; do not save, reopen, repair or mutate the model merely to obtain a read.

### transaction_preview_failed

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/transaction_preview_failed`

No complete preview is available. Inspect error.reason with the host: response_budget_exceeded requires a smaller independently meaningful authorized batch; projection_failed requires inspecting the project serialization failure. Preserve the session and never treat a missing or truncated impact as approval to apply or save.

### stale_write

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `refresh-and-replan`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/stale_write`

Refresh the outline and affected entities, then replan from their current revision and preflight again. A preview reserves no revision. Never replace expectedRevision and blindly retry the original transaction or save.

### entity_query_failed

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/entity_query_failed`

Inspect error.reason: invalid_query requires correcting the target; not_found/ambiguous requires current exact identifiers; response_budget_exceeded/non_json_value requires host inspection of the entity. Do not broaden queries or mutate data to evade the response limits.

### session_not_found

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/session_not_found`

Ask the host to confirm the runtime and project, recover any unsaved state, then explicitly open a new session if appropriate. Session IDs are runtime-local. Read its new revision and replan; never reuse an expired session or assume disk contains unsaved changes.

### session_close_failed

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/session_close_failed`

The session and lock ownership remain registered. Inspect the reported lock release failure, correct the storage problem, then retry closeSession with the same session ID. Do not remove the lock file or open a replacement session to bypass the owner.

### path_policy_violation

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/path_policy_violation`

Ask the host to review the attempted path and authorized project root. saveSession only writes the original project; it is not Save As. Do not widen allowed roots or bypass path checks. A separately authorized export may use materializeSession.

### project_root_not_allowed

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/project_root_not_allowed`

Ask the host to review the attempted path and authorized project root. saveSession only writes the original project; it is not Save As. Do not widen allowed roots or bypass path checks. A separately authorized export may use materializeSession.

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/invalid_component_selector`

Read the current outline and query the relevant entity. Use its exact identifiers, inspect the reported selector path, then rebuild and preflight the transaction. Do not guess identifiers or retry the unchanged transaction.

Owners: `core.transaction` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/unavailable_resource_source_bytes`

Ask the host to inspect the reported source and hydrate its bytes through project I/O or import. Preserve unsaved work; reopening disk state can discard it. No session hydration/repair API is exposed. Revalidate and replan after the host has supplied a complete project.

### missing_source

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/decode_capability_unavailable`

Validation is incomplete, not passed. Inspect whether source bytes are unloaded or a decoder is unavailable. Ask the host to hydrate sources or provide the required decoder (Node image validation uses optional Sharp), then validate again. Do not install dependencies or change the project automatically.

### session_id_conflict

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/session_id_conflict`

Use getSession to inspect the existing session. Reuse it only for the intended project, or choose a new session ID; do not close another owner\u0027s session to make room.

### lock_conflict

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `host-action`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/lock_conflict`

Another owner holds the project lock. Preserve unsaved work and ask that owner to close its session, then explicitly reopen. Never remove a live lock, force-close a peer, or bypass locking.

### event_cursor_invalid

Owners: `backend` · Recovery: `refresh-and-replan`

URI: `openfairygui://docs/diagnostics/event_cursor_invalid`

Read the error and getEvents cursor bounds. Request a fresh bounded event page without the invalid cursor and refresh the current outline before replanning; missing retained history is not evidence that nothing changed.
